# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

This is a Streamlit web application that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the IMDB dataset.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to input a movie review in plain English and receive a sentiment prediction: **Positive** or **Negative**, along with a confidence score.

The model is trained using Keras on the IMDB dataset and uses a `SimpleRNN` layer with `tanh` activation. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time sentiment classification.
